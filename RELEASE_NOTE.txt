- New test and profiling scripts added:
  - `edge_test.py`: Designed to test edge cases of geohash functionality.
  - `geohash_precision_test.py`: Evaluates the precision accuracy of geohash calculations.
  - `geohash_profiling.py`: Provides profiling for geohash algorithm efficiency.
  - `geohash_test.py`: General tests to validate geohash-related features.

[Important Note]
Version 1.1.0 delivers a complete and stable release, incorporating feedback and fixes from earlier stages to ensure readiness for production use.

[Test Scripts Details]
The following new test and profiling scripts are introduced in this release:
- **edge_test.py**: Focused on edge cases and corner scenarios for geohash operations, ensuring stability in extreme conditions.
- **geohash_precision_test.py**: Provides a framework for testing the precision of geohash encoding and decoding operations.
- **geohash_profiling.py**: Enables developers to analyze and profile the performance of geohash algorithms under various workloads.
- **geohash_test.py**: General-purpose tests to verify core geohash functionalities.

The scripts are under review and subject to refinement. Future updates will include final documentation and potential reorganizations based on feedback.
